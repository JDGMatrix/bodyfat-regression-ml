# ðŸ§  Body Fat Percentage Prediction using ML
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
An exploratory project on different scikit-learn regression models. This project explores how different machine learning regression models can be used to predict body fat percentage based on physiological measurements.
The dataset comes from an ARFF file (`bodyfat.arff`), and the goal is to compare models and find the one that achieves the highest accuracy.
